🚀 15 Days Coding Challenge – DSA Practice
Welcome to my 15 Days Coding Challenge inspired by @digg_deeperr.
For 15 consecutive days, I’ll solve and upload 3 Data Structures & Algorithms problems daily, with the goal of becoming more consistent and sharper at problem-solving.

📌 Problems Folder Structure
Each folder is named after the problem's ID and title (LeetCode-style), and contains clean, well-documented Java solutions.

📁 1-two-sum
📁 26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array
📁 53-maximum-subarray
📅 Progress Tracker
